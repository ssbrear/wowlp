# About [WoW LP](https://www.wow-lp.com)

## Vision
WoW LP has been created to offer World of Warcraft players an additional way to filter toxic players out of their groups.

## Usage
Several positive metrics are given as options to give praise to other players. A user must sign in with a valid battlenet account through OAuth 2.0 to give praise.

## Possible Future Development (Not Implemented)
Players will be able to see this information in-game if they decide to download and install a companion add-on that has not yet been created.

Given the limitations of in-game addons, users will be able to see the praises other players have received but not rate directly in-game.
