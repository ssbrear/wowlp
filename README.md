## About WoW LP

WoW LP has been created to offer World of Warcraft players an additional way to filter toxic players out of their groups.

The exact metrics that will be used are as of right now not determined. It is also not determined whether positive feedback, negative feedback, or some combination will be used in the final product.

Players will be able to see this information in-game if they decide to download and install a companion add-on that has not yet been created.

Given the limitations of in-game addons, it is most likely that while you will be able to see data from this application in-game, in order to rate other players you must visit the website.
